### Per-Post Settings

## Important Note

Before updating the plugin, it's strongly recommended to clear your WordPress cache. Caching can sometimes interfere with the proper functioning of the plugin after an update. Clearing the cache ensures that the latest version of the plugin is loaded and functioning as expected.

If you're using a caching plugin, please refer to its documentation on how to clear the cache. Additionally, you may need to clear your browser cache to ensure that you're seeing the latest changes.
